## Description

This is a Single Page Application displaying different tabs of information on each of the planets in our solar system. The goal of this project was to make my job a lot harder by building this without a frontend framework like React. This project is based off of a wireframe from Frontend Mentor. 

### Tools Used

* HTML5
* Sass/CSS
* Javascript ES6+
* JSON
